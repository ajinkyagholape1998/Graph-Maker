Making Graphs Using Matplotlib
In this repository, I have made a software application that can be used to generate graph like Bar charts, Histograms and Pie charts.
Let's see
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
* Python 3
### Installing
A step by step series of instruction that tell you how to get a development env running
1. [Click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download **python 3**
2. **tkinter**
```
pip install tkinter
```
3. **PIL**
```
pip install PIL
```
4. **opencv**
```
pip install opencv-python
```
## Running the tests
 
- **Bar Chart**

As you can see in above image a bar chart is generated using software application named as **Graph Maker**. In this,After clicking on Insert Manually button we can give inputs directly through input text fields. After clicking on Generate Graph button graph will be generated & displayed, we can save this graph as an image.
We can also input as csv file(a demo csv file is already given in this repository named demo.csv) using that csv file graph will be generate(output images provided in output images folder in this repo)

- **Histogram**
